# Machine Learning Practice Repository 🤖📊

This repository contains my **machine learning practice work**, including implementations, experiments, and notes while learning and applying core ML concepts using Python.

The goal of this repo is to build a strong foundation in machine learning through **hands-on coding**, real datasets, and practical examples.
